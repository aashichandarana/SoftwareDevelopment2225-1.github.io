        <h2>What is Crop Rotation?</h2>
        <p>Crop rotation is a farming practice where different crops are planted in a specific sequence on the same piece of land each year. This helps improve soil health, reduce pest and disease problems, and increase overall crop yields.</p>

    <section class="content water-conservation">
        <h2>Water Conservation and Efficient Irrigation</h2>
        <p>Using efficient irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation, can conserve water by delivering it directly to the roots of the plants or crops. This minimizes waste and ensures optimal growth.</p>

    <section class="content organic-farming">
        <h2>Organic Farming</h2>
        <p>Organic farming uses natural methods for fertilization and pest control, reducing chemical inputs, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing soil health for long-term agricultural sustainability.</p>

    <section class="content vertical-farming">
        <h2>Vertical Farming</h2>
        <p>Vertical farming grows crops in stacked layers or controlled indoor environments, maximizing space and water use while reducing the need for arable land and transport emissions.</p>
