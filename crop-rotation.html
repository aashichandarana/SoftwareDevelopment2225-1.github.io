        <h2>What is Crop Rotation?</h2>
        <p>Crop rotation is a farming practice where different crops are planted in a specific sequence on the same piece of land each year. This helps improve soil health, reduce pest and disease problems, and increase overall crop yields.</p>

        <h2>Water Conservation and Efficient Irrigation</h2>
        <p>Using efficient irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation, can conserve water by delivering it directly to the roots of the plants or crops. This minimizes waste and ensures optimal growth.</p>
